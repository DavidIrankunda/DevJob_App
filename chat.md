i just want you to support me we this design well. 

is for header 

"header {
    background: #398de6;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex ; 
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius:10px; 
    margin-bottom: 20px;
 }
"

were going to change only on background color. you know. not changing color just how it look like.

i want you to make that bg color.
be a border on the downside of left side.
and spread all color only up of each corner of heading.

make it nice and look good you know. like that it look like on image I attached.â€‹
